# IMPORTANT  NOTICE (13 JAN 2022, 22:04h)

Even if in theory the lists should be closed and published by the January 12th, it was detected that CNE was still changing files today. 
All PDFs were downloaded again, and will be compared with the old ones to make sure that the .csv file is 100% faithful to the final lists.
